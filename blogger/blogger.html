            Spy x Family follows elite spy Agent Twilight as he's given one of the most important assignments of his life -- Operation Strix. 
            The mission: to get close to the reclusive Donovan Desmond, the National Unity Party leader, and prevent him from disrupting the 
            tenuous peace between the nations of Ostania and Westalis. To do that, he must somehow create a family out of thin air and enroll 
            his child in Eden Academy, where Donovan is rumored to make occasional appearances. Twilight does manage to find a wife and a 
            daughter in less than a week -- under the appropriate-but-fake name "Forger" -- but little does he know, he's not the only one 
            keeping a secret: his wife, Yor, is an assassin and his daughter, Anya, is a telepath. Aside from the intriguing set-up, one of 
            the strengths of Spy x Family is the characters, especially the members of the Forger family. All three of them do their best to 
            act like a regular family, which often leads to hilarity as they struggle to balance their double lives. Although the overarching 
            plot is Twilight's mission, what makes Spy X Family one of the best and heartwarming series in Shonen Jump now is how this unlikely 
            trio slowly becomes a real family in their own right.
