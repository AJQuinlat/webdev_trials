# Website Development Trials
This repository is my attempts at learning about HTML and CSS by watching tutorials from Village88.
In these set of mini exercises I learned all about HTML and CSS.

## Learnings
- proper indentation in html
- use of forms and different tags in html
- not using header tags but using css to edit the UI of the website instead
- the use of lists for navigation bars
- the box method to utilize divs in partitioning elements
- how to copy static websites
- use of relative and absolute positioning to anchor elements
- what responsive design means and how it looks

## Recommendations
- learn more about responsive design and practice flex attributes in css
- connect html and css to javascript for more interactivity
